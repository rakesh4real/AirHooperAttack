	Now Tempest for leishen is for sending text file by FM boatdcasting

	=========================================================================

	What is it ?
	------------

	Tempest for leishen is a Program that uses your computer monitor
	to send out FM radio signals. You can then hear computer 
	transform file content in your radio.

	this document first describes tempest for leishen, the old program that
	transfer files like your cellphone does when you get a phonecall.

	How does this work ?
	--------------------

	All electronic devices send out eletromagnetic waves.
	so does your monitor. and your monitor does it all the time.
	and at very high frequencies. high enough for your short wave
	AM radio.
	all you have to do is display the "correct" image on your screen
	and your monitor will emit the "right" signals.
	Tempest for leishen displays pictures on your screen. one for
	each note in the file.

	[Note: Markus G. Kuhn's and Ross J. Anderson's paper; "Soft Tempest:
	Hidden Data Transmission Using Electromagnetic Emanations" was used as a
	reference when programming Tempest-AM. This paper is a must read before
	going further testing Tempest-AM. The paper is availabe from
	   http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ih98-tempest.pdf
	I strongly recommend to read the paper thoroughly.]

	Why this program ?
	------------------

	You need no additional hardware to understand that it is
	really possible to observe your computer without
	physically touching it. (tempest).
	I wrote this program because it was fun and because
	it teaches in an amusing way that tempest really exists.
	i want people to understand that their computers can
	be observed.
	And last but not least you can listen to music without a soundcard!

	More information on Tempest
	---------------------------

	Tempest and electromagnetic radiation is an interesting topic. There
	aren't very much public literature on this topic. Luckily, there are a
	few technical papers and web sites on the net that are a must read. 

	Papers to read:

	o Markus G. Kuhn's and Ross J. Anderson's, "Soft Tempest: Hidden Data
	  Transmission Using Electromagnetic Emanations"

		http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ih98-tempest.pdf

	o Wim van Eck, "Electromagnetic Radiation from Video Display Units: An
	  Eavesdropping Risk?"

	  Digital Equipment: The Laws of Canada, England and the United States"

	Here's a few links to start from:

	o Ros Anderson's website, is a good starting point and has links to 
	  go further.

	o The Complete, Unofficial TEMPEST Information Page, a great site. A lot
	  of links to other websites and papers.

	Compiling and runnning
	----------------------

	you must have libSDL installed.
	see http://www.devolution.com/~slouken/SDL/

	type
	  ./configure
	  make

	now start X11. make sure that you choose low colordepth this gives much higher speed !!!
	8 bpp is optimal.
	if the cpu runs at 100% the music will slow down, i.e. short tunes will get longer than they
	usually are. the song will sound bad :)

	start xvidtune.
	write down the values of 
	HDisplay
	VDisplay
	HTotal
	Pixel Clock

	now go and get a short wave AM receiver.
	(pocket radio, put switch into SW position (if it is named this way;))
	dial close to 10 Megahertz

	now start

	./tempest_for_leishen 146250000  1680     1050     2240   100000000  files/test.txt
		              pixelclock Hdisplay VDisplay HTotal radio      trans
		              *1000000                            frequency  file

	the program runs in fullscreen.

	now SLOWLY move a little left and right on your radio
	to find the 100 Megahertz FM. You will hear
	a didadi voice. 

        Record the voice to 8K 8bit wave file, and then use 
	python file in Receiver folder to analysis this wave file.
	You will find the file content displays

	Let's be a spy
	--------------

	Observe your computer from within another room !
	take the radio into another room. play with the antenna
	touch earth connections or other things. just play around.
	depending on the distance and the quality of your monitor
	you will hear good voice.
	i have a HP LE2201w monitor and i can still hear GOOD voice !

	Credits
	-------

	The original idea is from Pekka Riikonen. (see file AUTHORS)
	he wrote the program
	tempest-AM-0.9. i used a simplification of his routines
	to create the signal.
	The final Tempest for leishen is build by YaojieNo1.
